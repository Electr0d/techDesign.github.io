You will create a website about the main topics of this course.  Use Wix, Google Sites or something of your choice.


The following topics are related to the course.  Create the following pages (links / tabs) on your website.  
    On each page, add content that defines / describes that particular topic.  Include relevant images.


* Basic Skills - Briefly discuss the skills that may be needed (or beneficial to) someone who is in a job somehow related to tech design.
    * creative mindset
    * Artistic vision
    * Ability to work with a team
    * Knowledge in:
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * JS


* Product Design - What is product design?  Define and discuss.  What do these people do?  List some companies involved with tech design in some capacity and give examples.
    * What is Product Design?
        * Product Design is making a product to be sold by a company to its customers.
            Product design is a long process of narrowing down an array of ideas into
            one idea and then, making that idea a reality.
    * Companies associated with product design
        * Goji Labs: founded in 2014. Has a team of 3 employees who specialize in web, and mobile development
        * Grappus Technologies: product design and mobile developer based in India with an office in Atlanta with 10+ employees.
        * Sealab LLC: design service agency from Austin, TX. Founded in 2014, the employ five staff members experienced in UI, product and graphic design.


* 2D CAD - Define, give an example and discuss the software and how it is used in tech design.
    * 2D CAD, stands for "2-Dimensional Computer-Aided Design" is a design software used to make two-dimensional layouts.
        2D CAD has many uses, mainly creating vector-based layouts.

    * How is 2D CAD used in tech design?
        * 2D CAD allows engineers to create 2D vector-based 2D drawings, mockups of conceptual designs, within the computer.
            2D CAD is essential for engineers, because it saves time, money and resources spent on a project,
            and it decreases the number of measurement errors.


* 3D CAD - Same as above.
    * 3D CAD, like 2D CAD, stands for "3-Dimensional Computer-Aided 
        Design". It is a program used to create 3D-models of objects, such as, chairs, tables, 
        phones, computers, humans, buildings, anything. It is also used to animate said models, 
        like animating two humans fightigs. One of the most popular 3D CAD software used today is 
        called Maya.
    * 3D CAD allows designers to create 3D models that they can animate, or use as a prop for a scene or video-game.
        Video game studios like Valve, make their own 3D models that they use in their games such as: CS:GO, Half-Life,
        Portal, etc.


* Design and How it Affects Society - What impact does design tech have on our lives today and in the future?
    * Design surrounds us, from computers, to phones, books, cabinets, logos. Design is everywhere. Not only that,
    but design is used by many people to express their ideas, and identities.


* Technology and the Impact on the Environment - Include some information as we discussed earlier in the course.
    * Direct Impact: loss of land and loss of vegetation as a result.
    * Emissions Impact: emissions


* Design Process - Focus most of your time and energy on this topic.  You will need to research it using the internet (just Google “Design Process”).
    If you want to use more than one page for this you may. Include a detailed breakdown of each step.
    Include an image (which you may copy from the internet but cite (name/list) the source).
    Explain each step in your own point form words (do not copy everything from the website that you found the information on).

* Fix skills indentation for sub-bullet points
