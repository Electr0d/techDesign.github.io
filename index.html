                                    This step is very crucial. Find at least one problem to improve on in your design.
                                    For example: the annoyance of having to use the stylus to interact with a phone and having a physical keyboard even when 
                                    you don't need it led to the creation of the first iPhone.

                                    Present the prototypes to as many people as you can to get feedback from them. An example
                                    of this is when the iPhone designers presented iPhone prototypes to Apple

                                    example of this step is when Apple iPhone team refined the iPhone based on the feedback
